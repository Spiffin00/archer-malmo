	<center><p>Cookout: truly the highlight of this trip. I absolutely love the food at Cookout. Since there is one next to my job I often eat there on my breaks, and have become rather fond of the food. What I am more fond of, however, is the price of their tray combo. No where else can you expect to get that much food for the insanely low price of $5. Here my buddies and I enjoyed the remaining hours of our trip together by stuffing our faces and making dumb jokes with eachother. Afterwards we got back on the bus and headed towards the prison we left. Overall I would say the presentation was informative, yet slightly boring, but overall the field trip was a very enjoyable break from school. </p></center>
