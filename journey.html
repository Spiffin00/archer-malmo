	<center><p>I was pretty excited to go on a field trip. It's been a very long time since I've had once, and I was thankful to get away from all the chaos at school. The ride to Archer Malmo was a rather somber one. I sat with my field trip buddy Josh at the front of the bus as we took off for Memphis. We talked in the beginning, but resorted to listening to our own music. It makes the ride more calm that way. We arrived close to our destination and parked in a nearby small street. The street was only slightly sketchy, but since it was during the day I imagined we'd be okay. As we made our way to the cotton exchange I relished in the cold weather; It was finally winter time.</p></center>
