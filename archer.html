<center><h1>Archer Malmo</h1></center>
	<center><p>As we arrived at the cotton exchange I was taken aback by how elegant the place looked. I knew the building had been converted to a museum, but had no idea there were offices throughout the building. We took turns riding up the elevator to the web design portion of Archer Malmo. Even the elevators were fancy! Once the doors opened I was greeted to a very comfortable looking office space equipped with couches and a ping pong table. It certainly looked like a very relaxed place to work. As we all settled in the room, our tour guide came up and began his presentation on web design at their company. </p></center>
	<center><p>He began by explaining the basics of what web design was, including the work and responsibilities  that came along with it. After going through his overview he began to show us examples of some of the work that they have created in the past, as well as the projects they were currently working on. It was definitely interesting to see a website as it goes through the numerous stages of development. First the client helps them create a site map to get a better idea of how big the website it and what will be included. Second they create a basic wireframe and show it to the client to give them an idea of what the final product will look like. Next they create the website through a mutual effort between both the coders and designers to get the finished product to match their initial vision. Finally the website is presented to the client and is then altered as needed. The presentation wasn't as interesting as I had hoped, but it was still very informative. </p></center>
